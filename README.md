# German-Traffic-Sign-Recognition-Benchmark
# 🚦 German Traffic Sign Recognition with CNN 🛑

## 📜 Project Overview

In this project, we implement a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** for image classification to detect and classify German traffic signs. The dataset consists of images categorized into 43 distinct classes, representing different types of traffic signs. The goal is to classify images of traffic signs accurately into their respective categories.

The model achieved an impressive accuracy of **95.84%** on the test dataset, demonstrating its ability to effectively recognize and classify traffic signs.
